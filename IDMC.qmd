Statisticians of the SCTO Statistics & Methodology Platform wrote a white paper describing the role of a statistician from a Swiss Clinical Trial Organisation (SCTO) associated body when taking on the role of independent statistician in an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) for a study conducted with the participation of a SCTO network partner. In this statement, the Statistics and Methodology Platform proposes a framework for efficient collaboration between SCTO network partners to the assignment of statisticians to this role.
